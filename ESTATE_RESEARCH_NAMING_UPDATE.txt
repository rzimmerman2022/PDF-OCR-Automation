MAJOR UPDATE: Estate Research Project Naming Convention Implementation

## Overview
This update implements the Dennis Rogan Real Estate Research Project Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) v1.2 for file naming conventions. The system now provides industry-specific, deterministic naming that ensures clarity, chronological organization, and compatibility with automated systems.

## Key Changes

### 1. Estate Research Naming Convention Implementation
- **New Script**: estate_research_renamer.py - Dedicated AI renamer following SOP v1.2
- **Naming Structure**: YYYYMMDD_MatterID_LastName_FirstName_MiddleName_Dept_DocType_Subtype_Lifecycle_SecTag_LegalDescription.ext
- **Field Validation**: Enforces controlled vocabularies for departments, lifecycle states, and security tags

### 2. Department Classification System
Implemented 6 department codes (estate_research_renamer.py:37-44):
- LEG: Legal documents, court filings, attorney correspondence
- FIN: Financial - bank statements, investment forms
- ADM: Administrative - project management, vendor quotes
- TAX: Tax-related filings and documents
- INS: Insurance policies, claims, correspondence
- REI: Real Estate investment analysis, deeds, property records

### 3. Document Lifecycle Management
Implemented lifecycle states (estate_research_renamer.py:138):
- D1, D2...: Draft versions (unsigned, working documents)
- S1, S2...: Signed final master copies
- A1, A2...: Official amendments to parent documents
- F1, F2...: Final records of non-versioned items
- OCR: OCR-processed derivatives
- BK: Bookmarked copies for usability

### 4. Security Classification
Implemented 5-tier security tagging system (estate_research_renamer.py:47-53):
- P: Public - cleared for public access
- I: Internal - project team use only
- C: Confidential - sensitive information (default)
- S: Strictly Confidential - highly sensitive data
- R: Regulated - contains regulated data (HIPAA/PHI)

### 5. Comprehensive OCR and Rename Workflow
- **New Script**: Process-Estate-OCR-And-Rename.ps1
- **OCR Detection**: Automatically checks which PDFs need OCR
- **Searchable PDF Creation**: Uses adobe_style_ocr.py (NOT text extraction)
- **Progress Monitoring**: Step-by-step reporting with color-coded output
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time AI processing cost calculation

### 6. File Organization
- **Created _backup folder**: Proper segregation of backup files
- **Moved backup files**: .txt and .pdfbackup files moved to _backup (NOT PDFs)
- **Restored comm*.pdf files**: Corrected initial mistake, PDFs remain in main folder

### 7. Testing and Validation
- **Test Mode**: Process-Estate-OCR-And-Rename.ps1 -TestMode for safe testing
- **Successful Renaming Examples**:
  - 20170707_RoganTrust_Rogan_Dennis_W_LEG_Amendment_Trust_S1_C_Rogan_Revocable_Trust_Amendment.pdf
  - 20240422_24_PR_1803_Rogan_Dennis_W_LEG_Waiver_ConsentInformalAdministration_A1_I_RoganEstate_WaiverAndConsent.pdf
- **Verified**: OCR creates searchable PDFs, not .txt files

## Technical Implementation Details

### AI Integration
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for content analysis
- Custom prompt engineering for SOP v1.2 compliance
- JSON-structured responses for reliable parsing
- Fallback mechanisms for error handling

### Naming Convention Parser
- Matter ID conversion: Hyphens to underscores (24-PR-371 â†’ 24_PR_371)
- Special handling for Matter IDs with underscores (prefix with MID)
- Maximum 140 characters to reserve path length
- ASCII-only characters for compatibility

### Quality Assurance
- Pre-flight checks for text extraction
- OCR quality verification
- Duplicate name handling with counter suffixes
- Comprehensive error reporting and logging

## Usage Instructions

1. **For Test Run (3 files)**:
   ```powershell
   .\Process-Estate-OCR-And-Rename.ps1 -TestMode
   ```

2. **For Full Processing**:
   ```powershell
   .\Process-Estate-OCR-And-Rename.ps1
   ```

3. **For Individual Files**:
   ```bash
   python estate_research_renamer.py "path/to/file.pdf"
   ```

## Benefits
- **Deterministic Naming**: Any team member or AI can identify document context from filename
- **Chronological Organization**: Date-first format ensures proper sorting
- **Security Compliance**: Built-in security classification for sensitive data
- **Version Control**: Clear lifecycle states for document versions
- **Industry Standards**: Follows legal/financial document management best practices

## Files Added/Modified
- estate_research_renamer.py (NEW)
- Process-Estate-OCR-And-Rename.ps1 (NEW)
- Move-BackupFiles.ps1 (NEW)
- Restore-CommPDFs.ps1 (NEW)
- Multiple estate_rename_log_*.json files (generated during testing)

This implementation provides a robust, scalable solution for the Dennis Rogan Real Estate Research Project document management needs, ensuring all files follow a consistent, meaningful naming convention that supports both human understanding and automated processing.
