Repository Cleanup and Adobe PATH Helper Addition

This commit performs a comprehensive cleanup of the PDF-OCR-Automation repository
and adds a helper script to resolve Adobe Acrobat PATH configuration issues.

REMOVED FILES (Development Artifacts):
- AUDIT_COMPLETION_REPORT.txt: Development audit report tracking completion status
- FINAL_AUDIT_COMPLETE.txt: Final audit confirmation, no longer needed
- GITHUB_SETUP_COMMANDS.txt: One-time git setup instructions already executed
- UNIVERSAL_TRANSFORMATION_LOG.txt: Historical log of medical-to-universal transformation
- commit-message.txt: Temporary file from previous verbose commit
- Documents/test-document.txt: Test file used to verify folder functionality

NEW ADDITIONS:
- Add-AdobeToPath.ps1: Helper script to automatically detect Adobe Acrobat Pro
  installation and add it to PATH (resolves the "Adobe not on PATH" warning)
- Enhanced Setup.ps1: Now detects Adobe installations and suggests running the
  helper script when Adobe is installed but not accessible via PATH

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Setup.ps1 now provides better guidance when Adobe Acrobat is found but not on PATH
- Automated detection of common Adobe Acrobat installation locations
- Clear instructions for both temporary and permanent PATH configuration

CURRENT STATE:
âœ“ All PowerShell scripts validated and working
âœ“ Folder structure properly organized
âœ“ No syntax errors or build issues
âœ“ Successfully tested in preview mode (-WhatIf)
âœ“ Adobe Acrobat Pro detected at: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat DC\Acrobat
âœ“ Ready for production use

CLEAN REPOSITORY STRUCTURE:
- Core Scripts: Universal-PDF-OCR-Processor.ps1, Setup.ps1, Add-AdobeToPath.ps1
- Documentation: README.md, SUMMARY.md, LICENSE
- Resources: Templates/, Examples/
- Working Dirs: Documents/, Reports/, Technical/, Invoices/, Processed/

The repository is now in a clean, production-ready state with only essential
files remaining. Users can immediately begin processing PDFs by:
1. Running .\Setup.ps1 to validate environment
2. Running .\Add-AdobeToPath.ps1 if Adobe is installed but not on PATH
3. Placing PDFs in any folder and running .\Universal-PDF-OCR-Processor.ps1
