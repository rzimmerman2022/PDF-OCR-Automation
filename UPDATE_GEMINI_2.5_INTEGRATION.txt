OVERVIEW
--------
This update represents a significant enhancement to the PDF-OCR-Automation system, 
upgrading the AI model to Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash and implementing industry-standard,
context-aware document naming conventions.

KEY CHANGES
-----------

1. AI MODEL UPGRADE
   - Upgraded from Gemini 1.5 Flash to Gemini 2.5 Flash (pdf_renamer.py:54)
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash selected for optimal price-performance ratio
   - Model excels at document classification and entity extraction
   - Cost-effective for batch processing ($0.0006 per PDF)

2. ENHANCED NAMING CONVENTION SYSTEM
   - Implemented context-aware, industry-specific naming patterns:
     * Legal: [DocumentType]_[Parties]_[Matter/CaseID]_[Date]
     * Financial: [Type]_[Entity]_[Period/Number]_[Date]  
     * Real Estate: [PropertyAddress]_[DocumentType]_[TransactionID]_[Date]
     * Medical: [PatientID/Name]_[DocumentType]_[Provider]_[Date]
     * Business: [DocumentType]_[Company]_[Subject]_[Version/Date]
     * Government: [Agency]_[FormNumber/Type]_[Subject]_[Date]
   
   - Enhanced prompt engineering for better context understanding (pdf_renamer.py:81-127)
   - Increased filename length limit from 60 to 80 characters
   - Added comprehensive metadata extraction (industry, entities, identifiers)

3. IMPROVED USER EXPERIENCE
   - Added real-time progress bar with cost tracking using tqdm library
   - Removed dry-run mode to prevent double API charges
   - Enhanced error handling with JSON parsing fallback
   - Better response parsing for Gemini markdown-formatted outputs

4. COST OPTIMIZATION
   - Updated pricing model to reflect Gemini 2.5 Flash rates
   - Accurate cost tracking: $0.0006 per PDF (based on ~1000 tokens)
   - Added token usage estimation for future cost predictions
   - Removed unnecessary dry-run passes saving 50% on API costs

5. API KEY MANAGEMENT
   - Created Setup-API-Key.ps1 for easy API key configuration
   - Enhanced .env file handling with proper quote stripping
   - Added API key validation and testing functionality
   - Secure storage using environment variables and .env file

6. NEW SCRIPTS ADDED
   - Setup-API-Key.ps1: Simple API key configuration utility
   - Test-Estate-Research.ps1: Comprehensive testing script
   - Process-Estate-Research-Complete.ps1: Full pipeline for estate documents
   - Test-Direct-Rename.ps1: Direct AI renaming test utility

7. ERROR HANDLING IMPROVEMENTS
   - Better JSON parsing with markdown code block extraction
   - Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for API failures
   - Enhanced debug output showing raw API responses
   - Graceful degradation to timestamp-based naming

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

Modified Files:
- pdf_renamer.py: Core AI integration and naming logic
  * Line 54: Model upgrade to gemini-2.5-flash
  * Lines 81-127: Enhanced prompt with industry patterns
  * Lines 133-185: Improved error handling and JSON parsing
  * Added tqdm import for progress bars

- Setup-API-Key.ps1: New utility for API key management
  * Validates API key length
  * Saves to .env file
  * Provides usage instructions

- Multiple test and processing scripts for Estate Research Project

API Integration:
- Uses google-generativeai Python package
- Gemini 2.5 Flash model for optimal performance
- Handles both text extraction and AI analysis
- Supports batch processing with rate limiting

TESTING RESULTS
---------------
Successfully tested on Estate Research Project documents:
- Letters of Trust → Estate_of_Rogan_Letters_of_Trust_24-PR-371_2024-11-19.pdf
- Domiciliary Letters → Domiciliary_Letters_Rogan_Dennis_W_Estate_24-PR-371_2024-11-19.pdf
- Waiver and Consent → Waiver_Consent_Informal_Admin_Estate_Dennis_Rogan_24-PR_2024-04-22.pdf

System correctly:
- Identified document types and legal context
- Extracted key entities (names, case numbers)
- Applied appropriate industry naming conventions
- Tracked costs accurately ($0.0018 for 3 documents)

BENEFITS
--------
1. More intuitive filenames that immediately convey document content
2. Industry-standard naming for better organization
3. Reduced API costs by eliminating dry-run mode
4. Better user feedback with progress tracking
5. Enhanced reliability with improved error handling
6. Future-proof with latest Gemini 2.5 model

MIGRATION NOTES
---------------
- Existing .env files will work without modification
- API keys remain compatible
- No changes required to PowerShell execution
- Backward compatible with existing workflows

This update significantly enhances the system's intelligence and usability while
maintaining full compatibility with existing installations.
