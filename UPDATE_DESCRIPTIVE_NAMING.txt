MAJOR UPDATE: Enhanced Descriptive File Naming Convention

Date: 2025-07-22
Version: 3.1
================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This update significantly improves file naming to be more intuitive and descriptive,
making it easy to understand document contents at a glance while maintaining ISO 8601
compliance and systematic organization.

KEY IMPROVEMENTS
================

1. DESCRIPTIVE NAMING FORMAT
----------------------------
NEW FORMAT: YYYYMMDD_DocType_Description_Entity_ID

Example transformations:
- OLD: 20241119_LGL_RoganEstate_24PR371_v01
- NEW: 20241119_Trust_LettersOfTrust_RoganEstate_24PR371

- OLD: 20240422_LGL_RoganEstate_24PR_v01  
- NEW: 20240422_Waiver_ConsentInformalAdmin_RoganDennis_24PR

- OLD: 20250722_RPT_SysPerf_PerfQtr_v01
- NEW: 20250722_Report_QuarterlySystemPerformance_ITDepartment_Q2-2025

2. FULL DOCUMENT TYPE NAMES
---------------------------
Replaced cryptic 3-letter codes with full descriptive names:
- INV → Invoice
- CTR → Contract  
- RPT → Report
- LGL → Legal/Trust/Waiver (context-specific)
- LTR → Letter
- DOC → Document

3. CONTENT DESCRIPTION FIELD
----------------------------
Added mandatory description component that explains:
- What the document contains
- Its purpose or subject matter
- Key action or topic (3-5 words)
- Uses TitleCase for readability

Examples:
- LettersOfTrust
- ConsentInformalAdmin
- QuarterlySystemPerformance
- EmailChain
- PropertySale

4. ENHANCED AI PROMPTING
------------------------
Updated Gemini 2.5 Flash prompts to:
- Prioritize descriptive, intuitive naming
- Extract meaningful content descriptors
- Use full words instead of abbreviations
- Maintain consistency across document types

5. INCREASED LENGTH LIMITS
--------------------------
- Maximum filename length: 100 characters (up from 60)
- Allows for more descriptive content
- Better balance between detail and usability
- Compatible with all major file systems

BENEFITS
========
1. **Instant Recognition**: Know what's in a file without opening it
2. **Better Search**: Natural language searching works better
3. **Professional Appearance**: Clear, organized file structure
4. **Reduced Errors**: Less chance of working with wrong document
5. **Team Collaboration**: Everyone understands the naming system

TECHNICAL CHANGES
=================
Modified files:
- pdf_renamer.py: 
  * Enhanced prompt engineering (lines 91-161)
  * Updated JSON response structure
  * Increased character limit to 100
  * Improved fallback naming

REAL-WORLD RESULTS
==================
Estate Research Project files renamed:
1. Waiver document: Clear indication of "ConsentInformalAdmin"
2. Trust letters: Specified as "LettersOfTrust" not just "LGL"
3. Domiciliary letters: Identified as actual letter type

The system now creates filenames that are self-documenting and require
no additional context to understand their contents.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
======================
- Existing files work without modification
- Processing state maintained
- API costs unchanged ($0.0006 per document)

This update makes the PDF-OCR-Automation system more user-friendly while
maintaining all the benefits of systematic, ISO-compliant naming.
