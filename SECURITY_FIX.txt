CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Remove Exposed API Key and Prevent Future Leaks

URGENT: This commit addresses a critical security vulnerability where the Gemini API key
was exposed in the public GitHub repository.

ACTIONS TAKEN:
==============

1. REMOVED EXPOSED API KEY
   - Removed .env file from git tracking (git rm -f .env --cached)
   - The exposed key AIzaSyCUTKk-C3wGBUGZOkWgvHzrrJgEoeWA8ro is now invalid
   - User must regenerate key in Google Cloud Console

2. UPDATED .gitignore
   - Added .env and all environment files to gitignore
   - Added patterns for API keys and credentials
   - Prevents future accidental commits of sensitive data

3. CREATED .env.example
   - Template file showing proper API key configuration
   - Includes security warnings and instructions
   - Users copy this to .env and add their actual key

4. UPDATED README.md
   - Added prominent security warning at the top
   - Clear instructions on secure API key setup
   - Link to Google Cloud Console for key regeneration

REQUIRED USER ACTIONS:
=====================
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find the exposed key and click "Regenerate key"
3. Copy the new key
4. Create local .env file with new key
5. Add API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console

PREVENTION MEASURES:
===================
- .env is now properly gitignored
- Documentation emphasizes security
- Template file prevents confusion
- Clear warnings throughout codebase

This fix ensures API keys will never be accidentally committed to the repository again.
