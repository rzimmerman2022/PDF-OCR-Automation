MAJOR UPDATE: Upgraded to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash with Enhanced AI Processing

## Overview
This update represents a significant enhancement to the PDF-OCR-Automation system, upgrading from Gemini 1.5 Flash to Gemini 2.5 Flash and implementing comprehensive improvements to the AI-powered document processing pipeline.

## Key Changes

### 1. Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration
- **Upgraded AI Model**: Migrated from Gemini 1.5 Flash to Gemini 2.5 Flash (pdf_renamer.py:54)
- **Updated Pricing**: Adjusted cost calculation to $0.0006 per PDF based on current Gemini 2.5 Flash pricing
- **Better Performance**: Gemini 2.5 Flash provides faster response times and improved accuracy for document analysis

### 2. Enhanced Industry-Standard Naming Conventions
- **Comprehensive Naming Rules** (pdf_renamer.py:87-115):
  - Legal: [DocumentType]_[Parties]_[Matter/CaseID]_[Date]
  - Financial: [Type]_[Entity]_[Period/Number]_[Date]
  - Real Estate: [PropertyAddress]_[DocumentType]_[TransactionID]_[Date]
  - Medical: [PatientID/Name]_[DocumentType]_[Provider]_[Date]
  - Business: [DocumentType]_[Company]_[Subject]_[Version/Date]
  - Government: [Agency]_[FormNumber/Type]_[Subject]_[Date]
  
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Maximum 80 characters (increased from 60)
  - ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Industry-specific abbreviations supported
  - Context-aware naming with clarity rules

### 3. Progress Tracking and Cost Monitoring
- **Real-time Progress Bar**: Added tqdm integration for visual progress tracking
- **Live Cost Display**: Shows running cost total during batch processing
- **Improved User Experience**: Clear status updates with percentage completion

### 4. Removed Dry-Run Mode
- **Eliminated Double Charging**: Removed dry-run functionality to prevent duplicate API calls
- **Direct Processing**: System now processes files immediately without preview runs
- **Cost Efficiency**: Users only pay for actual processing, not preview operations

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- **JSON Parsing Improvements**: Better handling of Gemini API responses with markdown formatting
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when API responses can't be parsed
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: More informative error messages for troubleshooting

### 6. OCR Integration Verification
- **Confirmed Searchable PDF Creation**: Verified that OCR creates searchable PDFs, not just .txt files
- **Multiple OCR Options Available**:
  - Universal-PDF-OCR-Processor.ps1 (Adobe Acrobat) - Creates searchable PDFs
  - adobe_style_ocr.py (ocrmypdf) - Creates searchable PDFs
  - auto_ocr_solution.py (ocrmypdf) - Creates searchable PDFs

### 7. New Utility Scripts
- **Setup-API-Key.ps1**: Simplified API key configuration with validation
- **Process-Estate-Research-Complete.ps1**: Specialized script for Estate Research Project
- **Process-Estate-Batch.ps1**: Batch processing with cost tracking
- **Test-Direct-Rename.ps1**: Direct testing of AI renaming functionality

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Improved code organization and readability
- Enhanced error handling throughout the codebase
- Better separation of concerns between OCR and renaming

### API Integration
- Robust API key management with environment variable support
- Improved API response parsing with multiple fallback strategies
- Better token usage tracking for accurate cost calculation

### User Interface
- Professional progress bars with cost tracking
- Cleaner console output with color-coded status messages
- Detailed summaries after processing completion

## Performance Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: ~0.5 seconds delay between files for rate limiting
- **Cost**: $0.0006 per PDF (approximately 1000 tokens per analysis)
- **Accuracy**: High confidence naming with industry-standard conventions

## Compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Works with all previously supported document types
- Compatible with existing OCR processors

## Testing Results
- Successfully tested on Estate Research Project documents
- Verified proper handling of already-named files (skip logic working)
- Confirmed searchable PDF creation (not .txt extraction)
- API key configuration and validation working correctly

## Future Considerations
- System is now optimized for Gemini 2.5 Flash's capabilities
- Cost-effective solution for large-scale document processing
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

This update significantly improves the PDF-OCR-Automation system's capabilities while maintaining ease of use and cost efficiency. The combination of Gemini 2.5 Flash's advanced AI with industry-standard naming conventions provides a powerful solution for automated document management.
