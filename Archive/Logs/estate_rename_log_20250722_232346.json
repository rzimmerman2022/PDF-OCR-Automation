Rogan, as indicated by 'IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF DENNIS W. ROGAN'.

DocType_Subtype is 'Waiver_Consent_InformalAdministration' directly from the document title 'Waiver and Consent (Informal Administration)'. The Lifecycle is 'A1' because the document explicitly states 'Amended Waiver and Consent'. SecurityTag 'R' (Regulated) is chosen as it's a legal estate document containing personal and sensitive information. The LegalDescription 'Waiver_Consent_InformalAdministration_Estate_DennisRogan' provides a concise summary, following the TitleCase and underscore convention."
